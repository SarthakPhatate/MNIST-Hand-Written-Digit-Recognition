# MNIST Hand Written Digit Recognition
Hand Written Digit Recognition using Keras and PyTorch 

I have Implemented the Mnist Hand Written Dataset in Keras as well Pytorch.
Two of the above folders contains each of the project implementatons respectively

<p>Just open the respective folder and run<p>
1. pip install -r requirement.txt in your environment to get install all the required libraries
2. Then run createdata if doing with Keras(skip for pytorch)
3. Then run train.py

## Below is the train image example
![Train Images](Figure_1.png)

## Model
I have build a DNN(Deep Neural Network) model consisting of 2 hidden layer each with 512 neurons.
The model layouts looks like below
